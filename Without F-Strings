# Using .format() - Python 3.0+
name = "Arjun"
age = 21
city = "Chennai"
print("My name is {}, I am {} years old, and I live in {}.".format(name, age, city))

# Using % operator (older style, avoid for new code)
print("My name is %s, I am %d years old, and I live in %s." % (name, age, city))

#%s - For strings/text (like names, words): auto-converts numbers to text if needed.
%d - For integers only (like age, count): errors if you pass a float/decimal.
